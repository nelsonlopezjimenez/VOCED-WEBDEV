# voced webdev

## Motivation 
Working in an offline environmnet brings up a lot of different challenges to developers. The lack of readyly available resources, lack of interaction with remote developers, lack of up to-date online learning materials, lack of access to free, as well as paid training opportunites, videos, tutorials, etc, all that weight heavy on developers trying to master their skills and to keep updated in the rapidly evolving world of Web Development. 

## Concerns
A simple web search using keywords such as "tutorial on web development" or "express, mongo server", or "react" brings amazing amounts of resources, some free, some paid, some with heavy use of advertisement, that are difficult to navigate. Even more, difficult to ascertain the quality and expertise. Clicking a link of a video or tutorial leads to more alike links to follow up, taking us into a rabbit whole that is difficult to escape and/or control. Freely available training (be it a video, tutorial, article, project) are not restricted for modifying/redistributing. Paid materials, for the most part, are restricted to only online access, thus preventing people without internet to access them, even if they are willing to pay. Requests to make offline versions of  paid courses or paid tutorials are a waste of time,  since the only revenue for their authors is by constantly monitoring the users on a online environment. 

Here I am going to provide instructions on how to use and access offline materials obtained in different ways: downloading the entire site when allowed and feasible, downloading only parts of a site as mhtml or in pdf format (and losing functionality on the way), or utilizing publicly available resources that are or were part of online courses or trainings. I am a big fan of some names in the world of online training (free and paid), and to mention a few (the list may not be complete) I followed Flavio Copes, Maximilian Schwarzmuller, Colt Steele, Robin Wieruch, udemy courses, and many, many others. I could not avoid utilizing some of their materials freely modified or to some extent as originally written, just because they were already perfect to present to the audiences. I acknowledge it, because I am aware of the length and efforts to produce learning materials ready to distribute. I don't want to minimize or look 'lazy' for utilizing other developers' tutorial, videos, articles, when I know the hours, maybe sleepless nights thinking and preparing them. I myself have a share of generating some materials, but in the face of new students and lack of time, sometimes it is easier and more productive to give them a cleverly and thoroughly made tutorial or video with almost no changes to the original, hoping that the author would understand and instead of being hostile or upset, he/she would be flattered.
