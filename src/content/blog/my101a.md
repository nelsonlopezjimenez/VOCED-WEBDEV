# Building Web Applications using Node.js, Express and Mongo DB.

The purpose of document is to explain step-by-step how to create an express server from scratch.

## Node.js Explained

Node.js is a web server that is cross-platform and open source. Cross-Platform means you can run it on a Windows PC, Mac PC, Linux PC, or any of their server versions. Open Source means the code can be viewed and modified by the community at large. This makes Node.js a powerful tool that is ever expanding and improving, with no need to purchase new updates or fixes.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that runs on Google’s V8 JS engine. This allows you to use JS code for the back end (server) and the front end (client). Using one language across all areas of the server has many advantages to the old web server stack LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Python/PHP) which requires you to learn, know, and keep up to date several programs and languages.

Using Node.js you can serve static HTML files, dynamic web pages, and handle Web API calls.

## Express Framework Explained

Although you can build web servers/applications using only Node.js it is often easier and faster to use frameworks other people/organizations have created. Many such frameworks exist for running a server but one of the most common, and the one we use for the class server, is called Express. Express is a framework that allows you to create websites and Web API calls with less code, and easy to use features that you would otherwise have to hard code yourself.

Express is a thin wrapper around the Node.js http module that adds new features called middleware, routing and templating. Middleware is snippets of code you write that allows you to process incoming requests and outgoing responses. This allows you to look at each request and modify the response that’s sent back to the client.

Routing is how a web application responds to client request and calls the appropriate code to perform a task. For example if you visit http://localhost:22022/ this call is routed by the classroom Express server to a specified JS function that returns the index page of the class website, it can just as easily return a string, or an array of items, or a JSON object.

Express also supports the ability to build dynamic webpages using templating engines. This is known as server side rendering. Some common templates are EJS and Pug, and there are many others. Templating helps you build dynamic webpages by marrying the data of the site with the HTML to create a final HTML page that the browser displays.

## START THE VERDACCIO SERVER IF IT IS NOT RUNNING

### Step 1.1: Set up Node.js project, install express server. (Roughly 10 minutes)

1. All steps are intended to be done on your Desktop/Quarter4/Labs folder, unless explicitly changed.
1. Name your project "2024-Final-Project"
1. create a "backend-server" folder.
1. cd into your 'backend-server'
1. create a file: "touch app.js"
1. run "npm init" script and fill the questions as you see fit.
1. install express: npm install express
1. npm install nodemon
1. Your project should look like the figure [2024-express-from-scratch-1a.png](2024-express-from-scratch-1a.png)
1. Open package.json file to edit. Find the object with a key "scripts" and add the following:

```js
"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon app.js",
    "test": "echo.........."
}
```

**if you see "........" it means no changes made to the code on that block**

### Step 1.2

Since we are intending to be able to use newer import/export syntax, we need to let the app know about it by typing 'module' in the package.json file as follows:

```js
{
  "name": "backend-server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "2024 quarter4 pm final project",
  "main": "app.js",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon index.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
},
```

## Step 1.3

1. If you forget the previous step you will see a syntax error about "Cannot use import statements outside a module". Fix it by adding the 'type module' line in the package.json file.
1. The version numbers may differ from yours, ignore it.
1. Edit your app.js file by adding the following code:

```js
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const port = 3333;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!!!!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

### Step 1.4

1. In the terminal at the root of your project type
1. npm start
1. Open chrome, visit the URL http://localhost:3333 and you should see the message "Hello World!!!!". If not, make sure to fix the code. Look for typos, misspellings, missing expressions, commas, backticks, etc.
1. Conversely, you may open a second terminal and type the following:

```
curl http://localhost:3333
```

And you should see the message: "Hello World!!!!!"

## Step 1.5 Connection to the mongoDb server

1. By default the mongoDb server is listening on port 27017
1. If you try to access the mongo daemon on the browser, you will the following message: **It looks like you are trying to access MongoDB over HTTP on the native driver port.**
1. If you do not see the message, it means mongo daemon is not running. Immediately let me know.
1. Now the following steps are intended to create the connection to the mongo server.
1. in the app.js file, add the following import statement:

```js
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
```

Then add the following:

```js
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const port = 3333;
// THIS
await mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/finalproject');
// OR
await mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/finalproject');
// .......
```

### Step 1.6

**if you see "........" it means no changes made to the code on that block**

1. In your terminal you will see an error message **Error ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package 'mongoose' imported from ...**
1. The fix is to install the package: npm install mongoose.
1. You see in the connection line that you may skip the port number. The reason is that the default port is 27017, so you do not have to explicitly set it. Only if your mongo server is running in a different port you will have to explicitly write it.
1. The name of the database is after the colon (:) or after the port number (27017). Remember that the actual database is not created right away. It is only created (or space in memory assigned to it) after adding a new record

## Step 2 Adding public and other folders

1. In the terminal write:

```sh
mkdir public
mkdir public/image
```

## Step 3 Add some records to the database

In app.js declare an async function initializeDb(), add the array below with the starting data at the start of the function. The array will be provided electronically so you do not have to type the content.

```js
const initializeDb = async () => {
  const recipes = [
    {
      title: 'Spaghetti',
      instructions:
        'Open jar of Spaghetti sauce.  Bring to simmer.  Boil water.  Cook pasta until done.  Combine pasta and sauce',
      ingredients: ['pasta', '8 cups water', '1 box spaghetti'],
      img: 'spaghetti.jpg',
    },
    {
      title: 'Milkshake',
      instructions: 'Combine ice cream and milk.  Blend until creamy',
      ingredients: ['2 Scoops Ice cream', '8 ounces milk'],
      img: 'milkshake.jpg',
    },
    {
      title: 'Avocado Toast',
      instructions:
        'Toast bread.  Slice avocado and spread on bread.  Add salt, oil, and pepper to taste.',
      ingredients: [
        '2 slices of bread',
        '1 avocado',
        '1 tablespoon olive oil',
        '1 pinch of salt',
        'pepper',
      ],
      img: 'avocado_toast.jpg',
    },
  ];
  // declare objects wrapped in the Model to be saved in mongoDb
  const recipe1 = new recipeModel(recipes[0]);
  const recipe2 = new recipeModel(recipes[1]);
  const recipe3 = new recipeModel(recipes[2]);
  // save the recipe
  await recipe1.save();
  await recipe2.save();
  await recipe3.save();
};
```

1. To be able to add the data, we need to create a **model** of a recipe, with the **schema**. **Schema** is a JSON object that defines the structure and contents of the data. The contents are the default values, validators, etc. It is like the blueprint with the features that describe the data in your database. A schema maps to a mongoDb collection an defines the shape of the document.
1. A mongoose **model** is a wrapper on the Mongoose schema. It provides an interface to the database for creating, querying, updating, deleting records,etc.
1. A mongo **database** contains one or more **collections**, and each collection contains zero or more documents. Instead of tables, a mongoDb stores its data in collections. A collection holds one or more **_BSON_** (Binary JSON) documents. Documents are analogous to records or rows in a relational database table.
1. To be able to add data to a mongo database, there are different ways to do it.
1. The simplest is to initialize the data the first time express backend server is started.
1. Steps to initialize mongoDb:
1. let's add the schema and create the model:
1. edit app.js file to add the following just after initializeDb() function:

**if you see "........" it means no changes made to the code on that block**

```js
// initializeDb() .......
let recipeSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    title: {
      type: String,
      required: 'Name cannot be blank!',
    },
    instructions: {
      type: String,
      required: 'Instructions cannot be blank!',
    },
    ingredients: {
      type: [String],
      default: [],
    },
    img: {
      type: String,
      required: 'Image cannot be blank!',
    },
    isLogged: {
      type: Boolean,
      default: false,
    },
  },
  { toObject: { virtuals: true } }
);

const recipeModel = mongoose.model('Recipe', recipeSchema);
```

    Once we have the model we can use it as the interface to interact with mongo server.
    **Make sure that the line mongoose.connect is after line with recipeModel npm statement**

## Step 3.1 Async adding initial data to the database programmatically

Add the following code underneath the line with mongoose.connect statement

```js
    const recipeModel = mongoose.connect(.......)
    await mongoose.connect(........)
    //NOTE NOTE NOTE RUN ONLY ONCE THEN COMMENT IT OUT!!!!!
    await initializeDb()
```

1. You must run **initializeDb()** only once. Otherwise, you will end up with multiple copies of same data, because after time you re-save the file, the function would run if not commented out, resulting in resending the same data over and over again.
1. You could try as an exercise to write a function that checks whether the ollection exist, if true, delete the collection, then add the data. In that way, you would make sure that you always will start with three records in your collection.

## Step 3.2 Add the routes (or URL as in RESTfull applications)

The first route is to get all the recipes. The root route is:

    "/api/ver1/recipe"

Since we may work on a version 2 or more of the same functionality. You may see different routes depending on the exact implementation.

Select only ver2 for simplicity.

```js
   85	app.use(express.json());
    86	app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
    87
    88	app.get('/api/ver1/recipe', (req, res) => {
    89	  // const itemArr = await getRecipeAll();
    90	  let myArr = [];
    91	  databaseModel.find({}, (error, item) => {
    92	    item.forEach((i) => myArr.push(i));
    93	  });
    94	  res.json(myArr);
    95	});
    96	app.get('/api/ver2/recipe', async (req, res) => {
    97	  // const itemArr = await getRecipeAll();
    98	  let myArr = [];
    99	  myArr = await databaseModel.find();
   100	  res.json(myArr);
   101	});
   102	app.get('/api/ver3/recipe', (req, res) => {
   103	  // const itemArr = await getRecipeAll();
   104	  databaseModel
   105	    .find()
   106	    .then((allArr) => res.json(allArr))
   107	    .catch((error) => res.send(error));
   108	});
   109	app.post('/api/ver1/recipe', async (req, res) => {
   110	  // const itemArr = await addOne();
   111	  let result = await databaseModel.insertMany(req.body);
   112	  console.log(result);
   113	  res.status(201).json(result);
   114	});
   115	app.post('/api/ver2/recipe', async (req, res) => {
   116	  // const itemArr = await addOne();
   117	  let result = await databaseModel.create(req.body);
   118	  console.log(result);
   119	  res.status(201).json(result);
   120	});
   121	app.post('/api/ver3/recipe', async (req, res) => {
   122	  // const itemArr = await addMany();
   123	  let result = await databaseModel.insert(req.body);
   124	  console.log(result);
   125	  res.status(201).json(result);
   126	});
   127	app.get('/api/ver2/recipe/:recipeId', async (req, res) => {
   128	  // const oneItem = await getOne();
   129	  let found = await databaseModel.findById(req.params.recipeId);
   130	  res.status(201).send;
   131	});
   132	app.put('/api/ver2/recipe/:recipeId', async (req, res) => {
   133	  // const updatedItem = await getOneAndUpdate();
   134	  let found = await databaseModel.findOneAndUpdate(
   135	    { _id: req.params.recipeId },
   136	    req.body,
   137	    { new: true }
   138	  );
   139	  res.send(found);
   140	});
   141	app.delete('/api/ver2/recipe/:recipeId', async (req, res) => {
   142	  // const oneItem = await getOne();
   143	  let found = await databaseModel.findOneAndDelete({
   144	    _id: req.params.recipeId,
   145	  });
   146	  res.send(`record with id ${recipeId} was deleted from the database`);
   147	});
   148	app.get('/api/ver2/recipe/findOne', async (req, res) => {
   149	  let item = await databaseModel.findOne();
   150	  res.json(item);
   151	});
   152	app.get('/api/ver2/recipe/findOneAgain', (req, res) => {
   153	  databaseModel
   154	    .findOne()
   155	    .then((oneItem) => res.json(oneItem))
   156	    .catch((error) => res.send(error));
   157	});
   158	app.get('/', (req, res) => {
   159	  res.redirect('/api/ver2/recipe');
   160	});
   161
   162	app.listen(port, () => {
   163	  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
   164	});

```

You see different versions of the API. I want you to use the async/await syntax (syntactic sugar), instead of the promise-based, or (much less) passing callback functions. API ver2 is the one with such syntax. The other version are either promise-based syntax, or different variations of the same functionality, or showing errors that may happen.

## Example of async/await syntax using by reading the content of a file

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const fsPromises = fs.promises;

async function loadMonoCounter() {
  const data = await fsPromises.readFile('monolitic.txt');
  return Buffer.from(data);
}
```
